This Developer Studio Project file has been created by the QMsDev

a Main Window interface.

The project contains the following files in which you should add the
code for your project:

main.cpp
	The starting point for your application. Add startup routines, e.g.
	commandline processing here.

newprojectmainwindow.h
	A basic declaration of your application window. Add declarations of
	methods here.
newprojectmainwindow.cpp
	A basic implementation of the methods declared in
	newprojectmainwindow.h. Add implementation code here.
newprojectmainwindow.ui
	A main window.
	Use the Qt GUI Designer change the layout.

The following files will be generated during the Qt specific build
steps, and you shouldn't modify them:

newprojectmainwindow.h
newprojectmainwindow.cpp
moc_newprojectmainwindow.cpp
