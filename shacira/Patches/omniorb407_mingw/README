  patches for the build of omnior 4.0.7 under mingw32

  1. idl/corbaidl.idl
     LongDoubleSeq will be generally defined
     even if HAS_LongDouble is not defined
     this avoids compiler errors, when building
     under mingw32.
     This is only a workaround to build omniorb 4.0.7
     under mingw, so it is not recommended to use
     Long Doubles under migw32.

  2. src/lib/omniORB4/orbcore/omniinternal.cc
     removed inclusion of eh.h (this does not exist in mingw32)
     and the call to 
        _set_se_translator(omniORB_rethrow_exception);
     as a consequence. The same remarks as to patch 1
     apply to this patch.

  3. With this patch mingw32-g++ compiler can be selected
     when building omniorb under cygwin.
     this patch is not used when building under standalone MinGW.
