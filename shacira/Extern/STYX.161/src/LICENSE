Styx comes with two licenses, GPL and LGPL.  Overall,
the GPL v2 applies to the whole project. To enable the
use of the basic runtime library for commercial purposes,
libdstyx.so fall under LGPL.

See COPYING and COPYING.LIB for details.

More explicitly, the sources of both the parser and the 
scanner generators ( in the source directory 'libstyx' )
fall under GPL and are not released under LGPL.
