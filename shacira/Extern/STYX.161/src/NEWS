Jan 10 2001 - initial release (1.2)
Mar  4 2001 - release 1.3
              + fixes panic mode error recovery

              + hopefully fixes some configure problems on freeBSD (concerning libdl)
              + adds parsing support for binary files 
May  5 2001 - release 1.4
              + The embedded preprocessing facility is now reentrant.
              + The unicode support has been extended. 
                Now the specification of unicode-keywords should be possible, too.

Mar 11 2002 - release 1.5

              BUG FIXES
              ---------
              + fixes a bug in the production of the abstract interface. 
                Now the destructor functions for the start productions skip ignore-productions.
              + fixes a bug regarding the early reduction facility which sometimes causes an
                infinite loop.
              + fixes a bug in the preprocessing facility.
                ( an uninitilized variable sometimes causes a segmentation fault )
              + fixes a bug in the function putBString of the module binimg.c.
              + The print/reporting functions in the scan, parse, term and pretty print modules
                has been revised with respect to a more consistent unicode support. 
              + fixes the incomplete generated file Makefile.am in release 1.3 and 1.4
              + Now the COPYING file should contain the correct GPL license.

              ENHANCEMENTS
              ------------
              + The modules binimg.c and ptm_pp.c (persistence, pretty printing) are now reentrant.
              + The utility programs lim_test, pim_test and stypp has been revised. Now they all
                support preprocessing and unicode as well as dynamic loadable user-defined handlers.
                ( Note: You have to link your handlers with the runtime library libxstyx.so )
              + The term generation module [ptm_gen] has been extended to cope with external scanners
                and parsers.
              + The scanner & parser generation has been revised. In addition to the released runtime 
                library libdstyx.so the new library libxstyx.so also contains the generation functionality.
                Beside an improved modularisation it is now possible to include this functionality in
                other programs. ( Look at styx as an example. )

                
Nov 30 2002 - release 1.5.1

	      +	Automake conversion such that VPATH builds and dist* targets work.
	      + Avoid duplication of libdstyx in libxstyx.
          + fixes a bug in the function printSymbols of the module symbols.c.
          + fixes a bug in tutorial04. <ctrl>d now aborts the caculator.
              
Mar 15 2003 - release 1.6

          + fixes a bug in the term generation modul ptm_gen.c. Introduced with the panic mode error 
            recovery, the term construction failed if a syntax error at position 1,1 occured.

          + Starting with this release the Styx parser provides the toggle parameter -shortform
            to enforce the usage of short or long filenames (default: long filenames).

          + introduces dyck tokens to cope with nested comments, for example.
          + introduces (de)indent tokens to support the definition of indended languages.
            (see example06)
          + The scanner now provides more flexibility with the introduction of flex-like scan groups.
            (see example05)
          + This release provides support for embedded languages through the introduction of so-called 
            "embedded language" tokens. 
            (see the XML/DTD language definitions for a demonstration)

          + added a Styx based XML parser (library) 

          Compatibility Note: The formats of the generated scan and parse tables has been changed. They
                              must be re-generated in order to work with the new Styx version.

Dec 09 2003 - release 1.6.1

          + fixes broken windows project files
          + fixes a bug in modul styx_gen.c regarding the parser generation which produced a runtime 
            error in the windows debug version.
