</H2>

<P>Both the regular as well as the context free grammar of the language is
combined into one source. Keyword tokens need not be defined separately
within the lexical grammar, but are instead extracted from the context
free part of the definition. All grammatical information is contained into
one file with the extention ".sty".
<P>To give a small example how this looks like, here see the calculator
language below.

<P>Notes on the source above.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Overall, the source consists of three parts. The first, naming the
language, the second, proving the regular sets and the third, defining
the context free grammar.</LI>
<LI>In the regular grammar, the single quoted strings denote sets of
characters, while the double quoted strings denote strings. It provides
the terminals of the language.</LI>
<LI>The context free grammar consists of a list of definitions of
non-terminals each followed by their productions. The products are named
by the word between the two colons. Double quouted strings within the
production rules denote terminals (<EM>keywords</EM>), while names are used
for both terminals and non-terminals.</LI>
<LI>Although the language defined by the <EM>start</EM> productions is either
an expression or the word "end", this example language was designed for
a typical calculator tool, so one could enter an arbitrary list of
expressions, and terminate the session by "end". This is not mentioned
within the grammar. Instead, the Styx parser can be instructed to separate
prefixes from a source stream, so one can read in one expression after the
other. Of course, a start production will normally describe a whole file.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 The derived depth grammar / term algebra</A>

<P>Applying Styx, we derive the follow depth grammar (transformed to abstract
types) from <EM>calc.sty</EM>

</PRE>
<P>Some notes apply to this:
<UL>
<LI>First of all, note that a transition from grammical to algebraic notions
have been done. While we talk in the .sty file about regular and context
free productions, we have the signature of typed term algebras in the .abs
file.</LI>
<LI>Beside "Int", all regular grammar productions have been removed
automatically. This is both possible and necessary, since they only
contribute to the surface grammar.</LI>
<LI>The surface grammar, which knows about three different non-terminals for
expressions, necessary to express the binding strength of the
operations, has been mapped onto one type (Exp). This congruence was hinted
by the use of the ":ign0:" productions.</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Testing the language definition</A>
</H2>

<P>Even without writing down a single line of C code, one can already test the
language. With the following test string given in a file, we can test both the
scanner and the parser separately, yielding the following results.

<P>As one can see from the parser test result, full source information is
maintained. Not only that the keywords are preserved, but also the starting
positions of both the productions and the terminals are kept in the derivation
tree for later reference to the source, may be for diagnostics, may be for
other purposes.
<P>Note that the source tree shown by the parser test is the internal representation,
which is bound to the concrete surface grammar as specified in the calc.sty
file. One may have access to this representation, of course, but usually, the 
compiler writer will give preference to the abstract (depth) grammar as given by
the (generated) calc.abs above.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 The C language interface</A>
</H2>

<P>Styx provides a proper C language interface for this abstract grammar, by
means of a mapping convention. As soon one knows the mapping by heart, the
C interface (header) file is of few use. One will typically prefer working with
the .abs file for reference purposes. This becomes clear when having a look at
the C interface file below, which is much longer then the (content-identical)
.abs file:

<P>The interface will not be explained in full length in this walk-through,
instead only two relevant sections will be highlighed:
<UL>
<LI>The "AbstractType"s introduce the types of parse, mainly Cmd and
Exp. <CODE>AbstractType</CODE> simply expands to <CODE>void*</CODE>,
and is introduced to hide the implementation.</LI>
<LI>The most interesting part is the section in the end with the "Exp"
header above it. This section gives access to the expressions in
the derivation tree.</LI>
</UL>
<P>To each variant within the discriminated union of the Exp terms, one
destructor (in notions of algebra, not of C++) is provided. The naming
convention of them is "LanguageType_Variant". Their first argument is
the term to rip apart. The remaining arguments are variables for the parts
of the decomposition. The result of the functions is a boolean value that
becomes true if the destructor applies to the considered term, i.e. if we
have used it on the right variant.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 Using the interface</A>
</H2>

<P>With this preparation we can look at the source of the evaluator.
This is pretty straight forward. Speaking in notions of abstract algebra,
the following C function is the canonical evaluation homomorphism on Exps. 
It maps the type of Exps to C integers by assigning a corresponding C function
of the C integer algebra to every function of the term algebra of Exps.
Additionally, since an integer literal is also provided in the language,
the integer denotation is mapped onto it's meaning.

  if (calcExp_div(ex, &amp;x1, &amp;x2)) return evalExp(x1) / evalExp(x2);
  if (calcExp_add(ex, &amp;x1, &amp;x2)) return evalExp(x1) + evalExp(x2);
  if (calcExp_sub(ex, &amp;x1, &amp;x2)) return evalExp(x1) - evalExp(x2);
  if (calcExp_neg(ex, &amp;x2))      return             - evalExp(x2);
  if (calcExp_int(ex, &amp;x3))      return atoi(GLS_Tok_string(x3));
  BUG;

</PRE>
<P>Together with a few lines to initiate and apply the Styx parser, the
above function forms the desired calculator.
<P>Please note that the full advantage of Styx over yacc is not expressed
by this walk-trough. One can do this trival example likely efficient
with yacc's semantic actions. Note especially that the above evaluator is
in contrary to yacc not hooked into the parser, but instead applied on the
result of the parsing process. When the term was evaluated by evalExp the 
parser has already been gone, having done it's purpose by leaving a term 
derived from the source.
<P>The advantage of Styx's design immediately becomes aparent as soon as one
adds functions to the example grammar and defines an interpreter on top of it. 
Using Styx one would then find everything prepared as needed, while lex/yacc 
would require to do all the things that Styx offers implicitly. 
<EM>Perhaps we will extend the example appropriately in the next version of the 
document. Meanwhile we leave it as an exercise to the reader.
