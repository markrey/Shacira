The file mcfg.sty contains a scanner definition for the configuration language
used to configure, for example, the linux kernel.

It demonstrates the ability of Styx to cope with scan groups.

Use the shell script 'mx' to create the scanner image. 
Then run the command 'lim_test ide.config.in' to see the scanner output.
